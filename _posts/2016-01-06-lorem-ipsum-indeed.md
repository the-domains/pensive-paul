# Lorem Ipsum, indeed!

Not merely because this is just a fancy way to say "Blah Blah Blah" but also because it shows up mainly in places where the development of visual form leads the development of written content do I intend to allow myself to focus on the content of my words.  Thus I begin to use TheGrid(tm) with the hope that the promised AI will give wings to my words.  May my words be worthy of flight!
